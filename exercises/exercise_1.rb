#Exercise 1: Create 3 stores
#Use Active Record's create class method multiple times to create 3 stores in the database:
#Burnaby (annual_revenue of 300000, carries men's and women's apparel)
#Richmond (annual_revenue of 1260000 carries women's apparel only)
#Gastown (annual_revenue of 190000 carries men's apparel only)
#Output (puts) the number of the stores using ActiveRecord's count method, to ensure that there are three stores in the database.

puts "Exercise 1"

Store.create({ name: 'Burnaby', annual_revenue: 300000, mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: true })
Store.create({ name: 'Richmond', annual_revenue: 1260000, mens_apparel: false, womens_apparel: true })
Store.create({ name: 'Gastown', annual_revenue: 190000, mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: false })
